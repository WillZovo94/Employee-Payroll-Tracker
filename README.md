# Employee Payroll Tracker

[Employee Payroll Tracker Project Link](https://willzovo94.github.io/Employee-Payroll-Tracker/)

## Description
- This project includes a functional employee payroll manager. While it has a responsive design, it is also provided with functional javaScript code that helps enable the inputs to be shown in the window, as well as using the console to present average salaries and a random chosen employee raffle.
- My motivation for adding on to this project was to add functionality towards gathering employee information. This improved my ability and understanding of arrays, while loops, specific methods, arrow functions, and more. Working on this project further improved my understanding of JavaScript and how it works.

## Usage 
- You are given a responsive window that shows the employee payroll tracker in the following image.

- You're able to interact with the add employees button, which uses prompts to store the information into variables.
- While it cycles through all the information, it will also give the ability to add more employees if desired using a while loop.
- Once all inputs are created, you'll have access to the list of employee information on the window, as well as the console too.
- The console will also present the average salaries of all your employees using .reduce method with an arrow function.
- Lastly, the console will present a randomly selected employee to be picked as the winner of the draw. This is mainly created using Math.random and Math.floor.
- All of those listened are shown here:

## Features 
- Access to the add employees button which will ask for first name, last name, and employee's salary.
- it will give you access to continue adding employees or to cancel, which will show the information given to the application.
- If you open the console, you'll be presented with the employees' average salary.
- You'll also be shown a randomly picked employee that won!
