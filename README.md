# Payroll-Manager

## Description
- This project includes a functional employee payroll manager. While it has responsive design, it is also provided with functional javaScript code that helps enable the inputs to be shown on the window, as well as using console to present average salaries and a random        chosen employee raffle.
- My motivation for adding on to this project was to add functionality towards gathering employee information. This improved my ability and understanding of arrays, while loops, specific methods, arrow functions, and more. Working on this project further improved my understanding of JavaScript and how it works.

## Usage 
- You are given a responsive window that shows the employee payroll tracker.
- You're able to interact with the add employees button, which uses prompts to store the information into variables.
- While it cycles through all the information, it will also give the ability to add more employees if desired using a while loop.
- Once all inputs are created, you'll have access to the list of employee information on the window, as well as, the console too.
- The console will also present the average salaries of all your employees using .reduce method with an arrow function.
- Lastly, the console will present a randomly selected employee to be picked for the winner of the draw. This is mainly created using Math.random and Math.floor.
