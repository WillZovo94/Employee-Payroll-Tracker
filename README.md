# Payroll-Manager

$$ Description
  - This project includes a functional employee payroll manager. While it has responsive design, it is also provided with functional javaScript code that helps enable the inputs to be shown on the window, as well as using console to present average salaries and a random        chosen employee raffle.
  - My motivation for adding on to this project was to add functionality towards gathering employee information. This improved my ability and understanding of arrays, while loops, specific methods, arrow functions, and more. Working on this project further improved my understanding of JavaScript and how it works.
